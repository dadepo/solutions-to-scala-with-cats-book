My solutions to exercises in chapters 1 - 7 in [Scala with Cats Book](https://underscore.io/books/scala-with-cats/)

The implementation can be found in the tests.

TODO

1. Add notes containing some of the key insightful things learnt in each chapter
2. Add notes containing some of the concepts I still need to spend time understanding
3. Also do the exercises in Part II (case study section)
